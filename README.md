# NET-EXPO

NET-EXPO is a Gelphi plugin that computes various types of network exposure metrics for the purpose of visualization exposure within a network for analysis. Currently network exposure model (Marsden, et al. 1993, Burt, 1987, Valente, 1996, 2005), affiliation exposure model (Fujimoto, et al., 2011, 2012), and decomposition exposure model (Fujimoto, 2012, Fujimoto, et al., 2013) are supported.
